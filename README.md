# Developing Mechanism To Provide Context Sensitive Aware Privacy Consumers In cloud 
\
Basically our project main domain is privacy. Context means diffrent situation, for diffrent situation we are providing privacy to consumers.
\
In search of our domain we got only the security algorithms, we didnt get any privacy algorithm so we have developed our own hybrid privacy algorithm on the basis of security algorithms.
\
\
So to demonstrate our privacy algorithm we have developed simple android application, the foolwing steps are:
* The Pc and Mobile must be connected with the same hotspot
* Then we have to go for laptop setings in that we have off the firewalls like system, domain, public.
* Then we have to connect usb cable from mobile device to laptop.
* Then we have to run the xampp server
* Then open command prompt and type ipconfig and we will get ipv4 version address
* Copy the ipv4 version address and go to andaroid studio then copy that address to java main file
* Run the project in android studio
* Then the App will run in mobile device, the app will show the login page the user have to login by giving username and password, if user is not registerd then he/she have to register.
* After login to the app for example if user is in temple then app fetch the temple location within 100m range it blocks all the calls and mobile switch to silent mode.
* Then user come out of 100m range then mobile switch to normal mode and user get the notification those who have called and it also notification to the dailer "The person is available".
